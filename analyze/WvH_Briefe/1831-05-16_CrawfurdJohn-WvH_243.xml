         <div type="letter">
            <p>
               <pb n="125r"/> I have received your Excellency’s letter in the French language,
                    but from my want of familiarity with that idiom, and my knowledge of your
                    intimacy with ours I take the freedom of answering in the latter. I lose no time
                    in complying with your Excellencys wishes as far as lies at present in my power.
                    Along with this letter you will receive a vol: of Manuscripts in which I trust
                    you may find something to answer your purpose. The first paper in it is an
                        <bibl sameAs="100">Essay on the grammar of the Javanese language</bibl> in my
                    own hand-writing and a mere sketch. The second is the outline of an Essay on the
                    languages and literature of the Indian
                    islands<!-- title? evtl.: History of the Indian islands (Edinburgh: D. Willison for A. Constable 1814) -->
                    which contains some extracts and translations that may be useful to your
                    Excellency. This is also my own composition. The third paper is the draft of a
                        <bibl sameAs="99">dictionary of the Javanese language /English and
                        Javanese/</bibl>, and the fourth of a <sic>Malay</sic> <pb n="125v"/> Malay
                    dictionary (Malay and English)<note type="footnote" resp="editor">Eventuell sind
                        damit Vorarbeiten zu Crawfurds 1852 erschienener <bibl sameAs="1278">
                     <hi rend="italic">A grammar and dictionary of
                        the Malay language with a preliminary dissertation. In 2 volumes</hi>
                  </bibl> gemeint. [FZ]</note>. I
                    have also a dictionary of Javanese explained in English and another in Javanese
                    itself. Both of these are copies &amp; consisting of thirteen or fourteen
                    thousand words each, and should they be of any use to your Excellency, it will
                    give me great pleasure to transmit them. With the Vol which I have above
                    referred to I send the vocabularies of five languages. Two of these <bibl sameAs="245">the Burman</bibl> and Talaing or <bibl sameAs="1040">Peguan</bibl>
                    were taken down in my presence by the American missionary <persName ref="ajudson">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Judson</persName> and their
                    accuracy may I think be entirely relied on. The other three are languages of the
                    Indian islands, the Mangarai and Endé being two out of five languages spoken in
                    the island which Europeans call Flores, and the Malanao one of the innumerated
                    dialects of the great island of Borneo. These were taken down by myself from
                    Natives of the respective countries, whom I saw in 1824 at Singapore when
                    charged with the civil administration of that place. – These are but faible
                    contributions to your great work, that many <pb n="126r"/> of my manuscripts I
                    am sorry to say are at present at a distance and not accessible to me. Whenever
                    I can lay my hands on them it will give me pleasure to make further
                    contributions, and to fulfill my engagement to offer some oriental manuscripts
                    to your Excellency. Among the latter will, I think, be a copy of the <bibl sameAs="58">Brata Yuda</bibl>. The Vocabularies are accurate copies made
                    expressly for your Excellency, and as to the Vol: I beg you will make what
                    extracts from it you think proper, and return it at your entire convenience. – I
                    am truly sensible of the liberality with which your Excellency has judged of my
                    labours, and for the pains I once took, considering myself well rewarded by each
                    distinguished approbation. But I rejoice that the task has now fallen into far
                    abler hands, and look with pleasure and satisfaction to the completion of your
                    great undertaking, while I shall be proud if any opinion or contribution of mine
                    will tend to <pb n="126v"/> facilitate your progress. I place myself therefore
                    at your Excellency’s service for this purpose, and will, at least, give a prompt
                    and ready answer to any communication you may think proper to make to me. It is
                    more than ten years since my other avocations have enabled me to bestow any
                    large share of attention on the subject, but it still continues,
                    notwithstanding, deeply to interest me. – Before concluding I would
                        <add>beg</add> to mention that there will be found in a Vol: of the Batavian
                    Transactions <bibl sameAs="956">a specimen of Kawi which I furnished</bibl>, to the best of my
                    recollection, in 1814 or 1815. I would also suggest that some of the English
                    Missionaries have made themselves masters of some of the languages of the South
                    Sea islands and published grammars &amp; I think dictionaries of them – a
                    reference to which might be satisfactory.</p>
