            <p>It is a great while since I have had the pleasure to hear from you; your last
                    letter being that of <date when="1828-11-15">Nov.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                        15, 1828</date>, which I received ten months ago. During this interval I
                    have addressed two letters to you; one, dated <date when="1829-03-17">March
                            17.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
               </date>
               <note type="footnote" resp="editor">Der Brief datiert vom 19. März 1829.</note> and the other,
                        <date when="1829-07-23">July 23, 1829</date>. With the former of these
                    letters I sent you some N.<hi rend="superscript">os</hi> of the <bibl sameAs="293">Missionary</bibl>
               <note type="footnote" resp="editor">Textabschnitt von

               <bibl sameAs="293">Herald</bibl> containing remarks on the Cherokee language
                        &amp;.<hi rend="superscript">c</hi> and on the Polynesian languages. To
                    these I added a Review of mine upon our English Lexicography. With my letter of
                    the <date when="1829-07-23">23.<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> July</date> I
                    forwarded a reprint of <persName ref="rwilliams">Roger Williams</persName>’s

                  <hi rend="underline">Key to the Language of the Naragansett

                    extracts from it were published many years ago, &amp; very badly too, by our
                        <orgName ref="40">Massachusetts Historical Society</orgName> in their
                    Collections. The copy I sent you was a present <pb n="51v"/>
               <note type="footnote" resp="editor">Textabschnitt von "from the Historical Society
                        …" bis zum Absatzende ("… before this time.") am linken Rand mit Bleistift

                        Rhode-Island</orgName>, of whom I requested it. I forwarded to you by the
                    same conveyance thirteen <bibl sameAs="437">Cherokee newspapers</bibl>; and
                        <bibl sameAs="833">a little Review of mine upon the Study of the Civil

                    time.</p>
            <p>I wrote to you, that my time was much occupied with professional business in this
                    place. I have, however, stolen from my hours of sleep <note type="footnote" resp="editor">Textabschnitt von "&amp; from society …" bis "… any thing more
                        than" am linken Rand mit Bleistift angestrichen.</note>&amp; from society
                    time enough to print the <bibl sameAs="449">Vocabulary of Cotton</bibl>, which I
                    have often mentioned to you. I could not find leisure enough to prefix to it any
                    thing more than a short introduction, the object of which was to render some aid
                    in ascertaining the <hi rend="underline">pronunciation</hi> &amp; thus
                    obtaining, at least, <hi rend="underline">an approximated</hi> value of the
                    orthography used by <persName ref="jeliot">Eliot</persName> &amp; others of that
                    day. With the same view I have <note type="footnote" resp="editor">Textabschnitt
                        von "added an Appendix …" bis "… You will also" am linken Rand mit Bleistift
                        angestrichen.</note>added an <bibl sameAs="449">Appendix (p. 100)</bibl>
                    containing Extracts from an <bibl sameAs="494">Indian Primer in the Massachusetts

                        divisions</hi> of words in this primer, we are materially aided in this
                    investigation. You will also find, <bibl sameAs="449">p. 104, the
                        Decalogue</bibl>, in question &amp; answer; and, at <bibl sameAs="449">p.
                        105, and 110, two Sermons in English and Indian, preached by Cotton</bibl>,
                    and now published from his MSS. <bibl sameAs="449">The Dialogues, at pp. 81,
                        94</bibl> <pb n="52r"/> <bibl sameAs="449">and 98</bibl>, will amuse you; in
                    one of them you will notice a curious remark of an Indian, <bibl sameAs="449">p.
                        98</bibl>, upon some dialectical differences then existing between the
                    natives of the <hi rend="underline">continent</hi> &amp; of the <hi rend="underline">island</hi> called Martha’s Vineyard, which is only a few
                    miles from our Massachusetts coast. In one of my former letters I mentioned this
                    circumstance to you, which I had then observed on reading the MS.</p>
            <p>I send you, with the present letter, five copies of <bibl sameAs="449">Cotton’s
                        Vocabulary</bibl>; of which I will thank you to present one to the <orgName ref="1">King’s Library</orgName>, if, in your judgment, that will be a
                    proper disposition of it; one to the <orgName ref="3">Berlin Academy of
                        Sciences</orgName>, &amp; one to the <orgName ref="6">Berlin University
                        Library</orgName>; and, reserving a copy for yourself, you will be pleased
                    to dispose of the other <del>to <gap quantity="2" unit="chars"/>
               </del> as you
                    may think proper. I also forward the remainder of your <bibl sameAs="437">Cherokee
                        Newspapers</bibl>, from N.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> 14 to N.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> 46; in the latter numbers you will find many
                    interesting remarks on the singularly varied forms of the Cherokee Verbs, which
                    present a truly wonderful specimen of the mechanism of language. But these
                    analyses must be received, at present, as <hi rend="underline">approximations</hi> <pb n="52v"/> only, because there has not yet been
                    sufficient opportunity to make thorough investigations.</p>
            <p>It gives me much pain to be obliged to add, that the poor Cherokees are now in a
                    posture of great difficulty in relation to the United States &amp; the State of
                    Georgia. That State (within whose territorial limits they reside) claims the
                    right of governing them &amp; refuses to permit them to enjoy their own little
                    government, which they have taken so much pains to establish. Georgia contends,
                    that as a sovereign state, she has a right to govern all the people within her
                    territory. On the other hand, the Cherokees maintain, that their independence
                    has been guaranteed to them by <hi rend="underline">Treaties</hi> made with the
                        <hi rend="underline">U. States</hi>, which treaties are binding upon the
                    State of Georgia, as the Government of the U. States has the exclusive power to
                    make treaties; &amp; they contend also, that although they dwell within certain
                    limits which have been agreed upon, by the States composing the American Union,
                    to be the limits of Georgia, yet that they, the Cherokees, are not at all bound
                    by such an arrangement among the States – that their nation now occupies the
                    same territory <pb n="53r"/> (except parts which <hi rend="underline">they</hi>
                    have <hi rend="underline">sold</hi> to the U. States) which they did when the
                    Europeans first came to America, &amp; that their present limits have been
                    recognized by the U. States in several treaties. The Government of the U. States
                    offers to them, if they will remove west of the Missisippi, a portion of the <hi rend="underline">National</hi> lands in that quarter, where they may make a
                    new settlement. But the Cherokees reply, with much force, Why do not the white
                    people remove to that distant country &amp; leave the Indians to enjoy the
                    territory of which they have had the possession from time immemorial, &amp;.c
                    &amp;.c?</p>
            <p>Thus, you perceive, important questions of public law arise, very unexpectedly,
                    out of the peculiar relations existing between this nation &amp; the United
                    States. And the case is rendered the more embarrassing, because we have
                    ourselves for forty years past been encouraging them to abandon hunting &amp; to
                    become agriculturalists &amp; manufacturers, and thus adopt the condition of
                    civilized people. They consider it peculiarly grievous &amp; unjust in us, under
                    all these circumstances, to <pb n="53v"/> oblige them to abandon <hi rend="underline">their country</hi>; and, I confess, I think they have much
                    reason on their side. What the result will be, I dare not predict; but passions,
                    interest &amp; physical force, when united, are too apt to overpower the weaker
                    party, if his cause is ever so just. I hope the Government of my country will
                    not stain its character by any act which shall be condemned by the more
                    impartial judgment of the statesmen &amp; jurists of your Continent.</p>

                    particularly. It was bought in <placeName ref="Konstantinopel">Constantinople</placeName>, in the <pb n="54r"/> year 1819, by <persName ref="eeverett">M.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett</persName>
