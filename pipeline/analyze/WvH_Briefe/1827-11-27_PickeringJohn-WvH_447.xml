               <pb n="31r"/> <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>It is a great while since I received your last letter (which was dated the <date when="1824-06-29">29.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of June 1824</date>) and
                    you may, perhaps, be surprised at my apparent neglect in replying to it. The
                    truth is, that the delay has proceeded from causes altogether beyond my
                        <sic>controul</sic> – from circumstances mostly of a personal nature, which
                    it would be impertinent towards you &amp; unpleasant to myself to trouble you
                    with. I beg you, Sir, to be assured, that nothing less than the irresistible
                    force of circumstances would have occasioned any interruption of a
                    correspondence from which I derive so much pleasure &amp; instruction, &amp;
                    which I hope now to continue without so long an intermission in future.</p>
            <p>Since I last wrote to you, I have removed to this city (<placeName ref="Boston">Boston</placeName>) which is the capital of New England, and where the
                    advantages for pursuing my professional business are much greater than they were
                    in <hi rend="underline">
                  <placeName ref="Salem, MA">Salem</placeName>
               </hi>, my
                    former residence. <placeName ref="Boston">Boston</placeName> is also the centre
                    of our <hi rend="underline">Northern</hi> literature, and is only three miles
                    (English) from our University of <placeName ref="Cambridge, MA">Cambridge</placeName>, where there is <orgName ref="44">a valuable
                        library</orgName>, to which I <pb n="31v"/> have access. This, in addition
                    to the literary society of this city, affords facilities for study, which are
                    not to be found in our smaller towns. But although I am thus more favourably
                    situated both for <hi rend="underline">business</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">study</hi>, yet I do not expect to devote so much time as heretofore to
                    literary pursuits; for I find, that in a large town one is obliged to give an
                    undivided attention to the object of pursuit, whether it be business or study;
                    and, as I cannot live by literature, I must decide to live by my profession, the
                    law, and indulge myself occasionally only as an <hi rend="underline">amateur</hi> in literature.</p>
            <p>I beg to make my acknowledgements to you for the valuable present of your <hi rend="underline">Berlin Academy’s Transactions</hi>, and the copies of
                        <bibl sameAs="222">your own <hi rend="underline">Memoir</hi>
               </bibl>, which
                    last, you will allow me to say, is full of interest to all who like to take
                    extensive &amp; philosophical views of the subject. I delivered the several
                    copies of it intended for <persName ref="eeverett">M.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett</persName> &amp; other gentlemen.</p>
            <p>In return for your favours, I am now able to send you the long-wished for "<bibl sameAs="473">
                  <hi rend="underline">Grammar of the Language of the Lenni-Lenápé
                            or Delaware Indians</hi>
               </bibl>", by <persName ref="dzeisberger">David
                        Zeisberger</persName>. This work is just published, from the Translation of

                        Philosophical Society</orgName> at <placeName ref="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</placeName>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32r"/> It is <sic>undoudtedly</sic> the most important publication that
                    has yet been made upon the subject of the Indian Languages; and, as the author
                    was a German, &amp; adopted a German orthography, the work will be the more
                    interesting to yourself &amp; other literati in that part of Europe to which the
                    rest of the world looks for instruction on this &amp; almost every other subject
                    of human knowledge. You will now possess the means of knowing with exactness the
                    structure of a very extensive Indian language, or rather a <hi rend="underline">stock</hi> or <hi rend="underline">family</hi> of languages, from a work
                    composed many years ago by an honest &amp; intelligent missionary, who formed
                    the grammar merely for practical use &amp; not to support any theories or
                    speculations in philology. So that whatever results we shall be obliged to come
                    to, they will be results which rest upon well established facts; and, I may add,
                    they are facts which are in accordance with those stated an hundred &amp; fifty
                    years ago in <persName ref="jeliot">Eliot</persName>’s<bibl sameAs="124"> ancient
                        grammar of the <hi rend="underline">Massachusetts Indian

               </bibl>, which, as you know, is but a dialect of the Delaware
                    stock. Indeed I cannot but think, that <persName ref="dzeisberger">Zeisberger</persName>’s <bibl sameAs="473">Grammar</bibl>, so much more full
                    &amp; exact than any other, will excite the greatest interest among the
                    philologists of Germany &amp; other <pb n="32v"/> parts of Europe, &amp; give a
                    new impulse to these studies.</p>
            <p>During the last three years some other publications have appeared respecting the
                    Indians &amp; their Languages; &amp; some others are in preparation; of which
                    the following are the principal:</p>
            <p>1. <bibl sameAs="827">An Article in the North American Review, for Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. 1826</bibl>, which is understood to be from
                    the pen of <persName ref="lcass">Governour <hi rend="underline">Cass</hi>
               </persName>, who presides over a part of the United States known
                    as <hi rend="underline">The Michigan Territory</hi>, which borders on Lake
                    Michigan. The author has been a negotiator &amp; agent of the Government for
                    many years with the Indian Tribes, &amp; is well acquainted with their habits of
                    life &amp;.<hi rend="superscript">c</hi> and the parts of his review relating to
                    this subject are deserving of much attention. But as to their <hi rend="underline">languages</hi> &amp; general philology, he assumes to know
                    much more than he has a right to do; &amp; he has indulged himself in unjust
                    animadversions upon the late <persName ref="jgeheckewelder">M.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Heckewelder</persName> &amp; <persName ref="psduponceau">M.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> DuPonceau</persName>: His
                    ignorance of this subject was soon exposed with some severity (but not
                    undeserved) by another review published at <placeName ref="New York">New
                        York</placeName>, in an article entitled —</p>
            <p>2. "<bibl sameAs="828">Examination of an Article in the North American Review
                        respecting the North American Indians &amp;.<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>
               </bibl> By <persName ref="castigator">Kass-ti-ga-tor-skee</persName>, or The Feathered Arrow." This pseudo-Indian
                    name is understood to be a ludicrous compound of the Latin word <pb n="33r"/> <hi rend="underline">Castigator</hi> (which has an allusion, in its
                    first syllable, to the name of <persName ref="lcass">
                  <hi rend="underline">Cass</hi>
               </persName>) and an arbitrary suffix, <hi rend="underline">skee</hi>, to give the whole name an Indian costume. There has been no
                    reply to this "Examination"; but the author of it has been threatened with a
                    reply, though I confess I could not perceive that it was unsound in any
                        part.<note type="footnote" resp="editor">Laut Müller-Vollmer 1976, 267

                    (which I mentioned to you in my letter of <date when="1821-08-24">Aug. 24,
                        1821</date>) is now preparing for the press by our <orgName ref="40">Massachusetts Historical Society</orgName>.</p>
            <p>7. <bibl sameAs="437">A Gazette or Newspaper, in the <hi rend="underline">Cherokee</hi> &amp; English languages, is about to be published in the
                        Cherokee nation</bibl>. The types are now making in this city (<placeName ref="Boston">Boston</placeName>) for a new set of <hi rend="underline">characters made by a native Cherokee</hi>. I should inform you, that this
                    native (whose name is <persName ref="sequoyah">George <hi rend="underline">Guess</hi>
               </persName>, &amp; who is called by his countrymen "The
                    Philosopher") was not satisfied with the alphabet of letters, or <hi rend="underline">single sounds</hi>, which we white people had prepared for
                    him, <pb n="33v"/> in the sheets of a <bibl sameAs="816">Cherokee Grammar</bibl>
                    formerly sent to you, but he thought fit to devise a new <hi rend="underline">syllabic</hi> alphabet; which is quite contrary to our notions of a useful
                    alphabetic system. He has, by his own analysis, reduced all the <hi rend="underline">syllables</hi> of their language to about <hi rend="underline">eighty three</hi>, &amp; his alphabet accordingly consists
                    of 83 arbitrary characters, instead of 16 or 18 Roman letters. He has, however,
                    taken the Roman letters as the basis &amp; has only added to them some little
                    marks, or has distorted their shapes in order to suit his purpose. This is much
                    to be regretted as respects the facility of communication between these Indians
                    &amp; the white people; &amp; the plan seems to us to be very unphilosophical.
                    But, strange as it may appear, the fact is, that either by force of national
                    pride (for which we cannot blame them) or by reason of the greater convenience
                    of this syllabic alphabet, the use of the new characters has spread among them
                    in the most inconceivable manner, &amp; they learn with great rapidity, both the
                        <hi rend="underline">old</hi> <sic>&amp;</sic> people &amp; the <hi rend="underline">young</hi>. So strong is their partiality for this national
                    alphabet, that our missionaries have been obliged to yield to the impulse, &amp;
                    consent to print their books in future in the new character instead of the Roman
                    letters. As soon as the newspaper is begun, I shall not fail to transmit <pb n="34r"/> some of the numbers to you, which will certainly be a great
                    curiosity to the world. I send you a journal, called the <bibl sameAs="295">Missionary Herald, giving some account of this new alphabet. <hi rend="underline">See p. 212</hi>.</bibl>

            <p>You will perceive by the above list of publications, that we are not idle; &amp;
                    I hope every succeeding year will be more fertile. I shall not omit to inform
                    you of our progress from time to time.</p>
            <p>I have been long hoping to see your great work on the American Languages; but I
                    know how laborious an undertaking it must be, &amp; therefore I wait with all
                    the patience I can command.</p>
            <p>I hope you will receive this letter &amp; the accompanying books in safety, &amp;
                    that I shall have the pleasure of a letter from you, informing me of what has
                    been done in Germany on the subject of the American languages. I hope above all
                    things, for the benefit of learning, that the weakness of your eyes has entirely
                    left you, and that you are now able to pursue your favourite studies, by night
                    as <pb n="34v"/> well as by day, so that I may have many more opportunities of
                    making my acknowledgements to you for new instruction.</p>
