            <p>I have to return you a great many thanks for your very obliging letter of the
                        <date when="1827-07-07">7th of last month</date> &amp; for the copy which
                    you have done me the favor to send me of your letter to <persName ref="jpabel">Monsieur Remusat</persName>
            </p>
            <p>The philosophical manner in which you have treated the subject of the Chinese
                    &amp; Sanscrit languages will do more than any work which has yet been published
                    to interest the literary characters of Europe in questions of this description
                    &amp; all those who are desirous of promoting the civilisation &amp; prosperity
                    of the inhabitants of Asia ought to hail the publication of your letter to
                        <persName ref="jpabel">Remusat</persName> as one of the most auspicious
                        <unclear>merits</unclear> which has occured in the history of the study of
                    Oriental languages. <pb n="122v"/> I requested our Librarian <persName ref="whuttmann">Mr. Hautman</persName>
               <note type="footnote" resp="editor">Gemeint ist William Huttmann, Sekretär der Royal Asiatic Society bis

                    who has, I understand, acquired a general knowledge of the Chinese language to

                    send you by <persName ref="hbuelow">Baron Bulow</persName> a copy of that
                    Gazette. I cannot help feeling a regret that he has not been able to enter more
                    in detail into the very great merits of your work &amp; into the very beneficial
                    effect in a literary point of view, which must inevitably be produced, both in
                    Asia &amp; in Europe, by the popularity &amp; éclat which you have given, to the
                    study of Oriental Literature by associating your name &amp; literary fame with a

                        <persName ref="hbuelow">Baron Bulow</persName> will deliver to you a

                    possess in print relative to the grammar &amp; languages of those people. I am

                    any, transmit them to you through the Prussian Embassy.</p>
            <p>As <persName ref="eupham">Mr. Upham</persName> is about to publish <bibl sameAs="439">a work</bibl> which will contain more authentic information than

               <salute>To the Chairman and <lb/>Deputy Chairman
                        of the <lb/>Court of Directors. <lb/>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have the honor, at the request of <persName ref="eupham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Upham</persName> to enclose to you a letter
                    from him soliciting the patronage of your Honorable Court to <bibl sameAs="604">an
                        English translation</bibl> which he is about to publish of the Three Works,
                    called The Mahá-vansi – The Rájá-valí – and The Rájá-ratnácari. – The first is
                    written in the Pali and the other two in the Cingalese language and they are all
                    three explanatory of the Origin, Doctrines, and Introduction into the Island of
                    Ceylon, of the Buddhoo Religion.</p>
            <p>The English translation was a short time ago given by me to <persName ref="eupham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Upham</persName> upon his
                    expressing a wish to publish some genuine Account of a religion which whatever
                    may be the nature and tendency of its doctrines, deserves the consideration of
                    the Philosopher and the Statesman, from the unlimited influence which it at
                    present exercises over so man millions of the inhabitants of Asia. –</p>
            <p>The circumstances under which I received the Three Works to which I have just
                    alluded, afford such strong evidence of their authenticity, and of the respect
                    in which they are held by the Buddhists of Ceylon, that I shall take the liberty
                    of stating them to you, that your Honorable Court may form some judgment as to
                    the degree of encouragement which you may be justified in giving to <persName ref="eupham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Upham</persName>.</p>
            <p>After a very long residence on Ceylon as Chief Justice and First Member of H. M.
                    Council on that Island and after a constant intercourse, both literary and
                    official for many years with the natives of every Cast, and of every religious
                    persuasion in the Country, I felt it to be my duty to submit it as my official
                    opinion to H. M. Government <pb n="120v"/> that it was absolutely necessary in
                    order to secure for the natives of Ceylon a popular and a really efficient
                    administration of Justice, to compile for their separate use a special Code of
                    Laws which, at the same time that it was founded upon the universally admitted,
                    and therefore universally applicable abstract principles of justice, should be
                    scrupulously adapted to the local circumstances of the Country and to the
                    peculiar religion, manners, usages, and feelings of the people. H. M. Government
                    fully approved of my opinion, and officially authorised me to take the necessary
                    steps for framing such a Code.</p>
            <p>Having publicly informed all the natives of the Island of the use and beneficial
                    object which H. M. Government had in view, I called upon the most learned and
                    the most celebrated of the Priests of Buddhoo, both those who had been educated
                    on Ceylon, and those who had been educated in the Burmese Empire to co-operate
                    with me in carrying H. M.’s gracious intention into effect, and to procure for
                    me, as well from Books as other sources, the most authentic information that
                    could be obtained relative to the Religion, <sic>usuages</sic>, manners, and
                    feelings of the people, who professed the Buddhoo Religion on the Island of
                    Ceylon.</p>
            <p>The Priests after much consideration amongst themselves, and after frequent
                    consultations with their followers in every part of the Island, presented to me
                    the Copies which I now possess of the Mahá-vansí, Rájá-valí, and Rájá-ratnácarí,
                    as containing according to the judgment of the best informed of the Buddhist
                    Priests on Ceylon, the most genuine Account which is extant of the origin of the
                    Buddhoo Religion, of its doctrines, of its introduction into Ceylon, and of the
                    effects, moral and political, which those doctrines had, from time to time,
                    produced upon <pb n="121r"/> the conduct of the native Government, and upon the
                    manners and <sic>usuages</sic> of the native inhabitants of the Country. As the
                    Priests themselves, as well as all the people of the Country from being aware of
                    the object which I had in view, felt themselves directly interested in the
                    authenticity of the information which I received, and as they all concurred in
                    opinion with respect to the authenticity and value of the information which
                    these Works contain, I have no doubt whatever, that the Account which they give
                    of the origin and doctrines of the Buddhoo Religion is that which is universally
                    believed to be the true Account by all the Buddhist inhabitants of Ceylon. –</p>
            <p>The Copies of these Works which were presented to me by the Priests, after having
                    been, by my direction, compared with all the best Copies of the same Works in
                    the different temples of Buddhoo on Ceylon, were carefully revised and corrected
                    by two of the ablest Priests of Buddhoo on that Island. – An English translation
                    of them was then made by my official translators under the superintendance of
                    the late Native Chief of the Cinnamon Department, who was himself the best
                    native Pali and Cingalese scholar in the Country; and that translation is now
                    revising for <persName ref="eupham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.
