               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>On recurring to <ref type="link" target="359">your last letter</ref> (dated the <date when="1831-10-27">27.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of October 1831</date>) which, however, did
                    not reach me till some time after that date, I should feel quite ashamed of
                    myself for not having made an immediate reply to it, if I were not persuaded,
                    that your kindness would ascribe this delay to necessary causes &amp; not to any
                    want of inclination on my part. The truth unfortunately is, Sir, as I have
                    before observed to you, that my engagements of business in this city leave no
                    leisure for study; and I feel unwilling to send you a letter unless it can be
                    accompanied with something of value.</p>
            <p>I am now happy to have it in my power to transmit to you an important work on our
                    American Languages – the <bibl sameAs="353">
                  <hi rend="underline">Abnaki
                            Dictionary</hi>
               </bibl> of <persName ref="srasles">Father
                        Rasles</persName>, of which I have frequently spoken to you. After several
                    attempts we have at length succeeded in getting it printed. This has been done
                    by the <orgName ref="43">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</orgName> (in
                        <placeName ref="Boston">Boston</placeName>) at whose request I undertook to
                    discharge the editorial duties that should be requisite. This laborious task has
                    occupied all my leisure hours for many months; the manuscript, though written in
                    a fair hand, is in many places difficult to read, and has numerous
                    abbreviations; besides which, there were other difficulties.</p>
            <p>I have added to the <bibl sameAs="353">Dictionary</bibl> an Introductory Memoir
                    &amp; a few Notes, in order to inform general readers of its value &amp; of some
                    of the results to be obtained from works of this kind. You will find <pb n="61v"/> nothing in my part of the publication which will be new or useful to
                    yourself; unless, possibly, some of the etymologies at the bottom of the pages,
                    and the remarks, in the Supplementary Notes, on the characteristic differences
                    of certain dialects of the Lenapé family shall be found worthy of your notice.
                    Without an exact &amp; minute attention to the dialectical distinctions, I need
                    not inform you, Sir, that we shall lose half the value of our materials for
                    comparative Philology. I beg leave, in the present instance, to refer you to my
                    remarks on <bibl sameAs="353">pp. 571, 572</bibl>, of the Notes.</p>
            <p>I regret much, that I could not possibly find time to make an <hi rend="underline">Index</hi> of the Indian words, which is highly necessary,
                    in order to give the greatest practicable utility to the work; but my
                    engagements would not permit this additional labour. Perhaps I may do it in the
                    next volume of our Memoirs.</p>
            <p>With the <bibl sameAs="353">Dictionary of Rasles</bibl> I send you a copy of
                        <persName ref="jcotton">Cotton</persName>’s <bibl sameAs="449">Vocabulary of
                        the <hi rend="underline">Massachusetts</hi> dialect</bibl>, (of about the
                    same epoch) the five copies which I sent some years ago having, as you inform
                    me, been lost.</p>
            <p>It gives me great pleasure to learn, that <bibl sameAs="811">my little Article on
                        the Indian Languages (published in our Encyclopedia Americana)</bibl> has
                    been read by you with any interest, and that you say I have understood your
                    views. This favourable opinion I must not ascribe so much to its intrinsic merit
                    as to your benevolence and candour. I need not assure you, Sir, that the Article
                    was intended, not for such readers <pb n="62r"/> as yourself, but only for those
                    who are unacquainted with the subject. I am glad to see that it has attracted
                    the notice of the German Reviewers in the <bibl sameAs="164">Heidelb. Jahrb. d.

            <p>I send you on this occasion two other books, viz: <bibl sameAs="425">The Gospel of

                    pleased to see that our missionaries have adopted my views as to their
                    orthography, instead of following our irregular &amp; barbarous English method.
                    They assure me that the children of the Islanders learn to read more rapidly,
                    beyond all comparison, than our children here learn to read English; which
                    facility they ascribe almost entirely to the simplicity of the orthography. But
                    there is, after all, an extreme difficulty, they say, in deciding upon some of
                    the sounds in those languages, in consequence of the careless &amp; irregular
                    habits of speaking among the people in general. Upon this subject I will give
                    you a few details in a future letter, if the subject is within the range of your
                    inquiries.</p>
            <p>I am greatly obliged to you for your various Memoirs accompanying your last
                    letter; they are all of the highest interest to me personally, as they are among
                    the few books which I read more than once; and I hope by the assiduous study of
                    them to make my letters more worthy of your attention. <bibl sameAs="385">Your
                        Correspondence with Schiller</bibl> is read with much interest by our
                    German scholars.</p>
            <p>Permit me to say, that we are anxiously looking for your great work on the
                    American Languages. Your Introduction (which you mentioned some years ago) has
                    never reached me; perhaps you have not yet completed it. I hope <pb n="62v"/> your eyes &amp; your right hand, of which you formerly complained, have
                    recovered their strength.</p>
            <p>On the subject of <persName ref="srasles">Rasles</persName>’ <bibl sameAs="353">Dictionary</bibl> I beg leave to add further, that, as the interpretation
                    is in <hi rend="underline">French</hi> I hope it will attract more general
                    attention on the Continent of Europe than it would in <hi rend="underline">English</hi>. The notice of such publications in your ablest Reviews has a
                    powerful effect in our country to encourage the study of the aboriginal
                    languages; and we need every stimulus to incite our young men to investigations,
                    which lie out of the ordinary range of their studies.</p>
            <p>I have lately had the pleasure of seeing <persName ref="jbharrison">M.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harrison</persName>, whom I formerly took the
                    liberty of introducing to you. He speaks of your kind attentions to him, with
                    many other particulars, which much interested me and demand my thanks.</p>
            <p>I have recently had the high gratification of obtaining your portrait, in a
                    lithographic print of <persName ref="foldermann">Oldermann</persName>, published
                    by Sachse and Comp<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. at <placeName ref="Berlin">Berlin</placeName>
